        <p> My name is Behad Behluli and I was born and raised in Kosovo, a small Eastern European country. I moved to the States 4 years ago, when I was 19. Living in New York has been a dream of mine ever since I was a kid so one day I decided to just go for it. It definitely lived up to my expectations and it's been a great 4 years so far. Well, minus the situation right now. I have worked in the restaurant industry since the very beginning and I started my school this semester. My major is Video Arts and Technology and I am definitely enjoying the things that this major has to offer. I live in Brooklyn and commute to Manhattan daily for school and work. I dream to work in the television indistry in the future. </p>
