<p> Description: For my gif animation assignment I chose a short clip of mine at the beach. I look very happy in it and I felt like I should have it as a gif as well. </p>

      <p>Title: Behad Horror Story Audio Project </p>

      <p>Semester/Year: SPRING 2020 </p>

      <p> Software: Audacity </p>

      <p> Description: My story took place in an apartment where the main character gets home, lights up a cigarette and is listening to a song on his record player </p>
      <p> when someone knocks on the door and then there's a gunshot heard. I used around 10 audio files to create my story.</p>
