    <p>My Raster Assignment</p>
    <img src="images/Behad_SelfPortrait_f.jpg" height="400px"/>
    <p> Title: Behad's Self Portrait</p>
    <p> Semester/Year: SPRING 2020 </p>
    <p> Software: Adobe Photoshop </p>
<p> Description: I first chose a self portrait of mine and then I used two other images for my project. The reason I chose those images as my background </p>
    <p> was because I feel like those hues fit my bubbly yet laid back personality. I also picked two seagulls because they remind me of the beach and sunsets </p>
    <p> at the beach are so peaceful and I love them. All content is mine.</p>
